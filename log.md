# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 26, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Started the Harvard CS50 intro to Computer Science course on edX, and completed the "basic HTML and HTML5" block on FreeCodeCamp (after restarting my progress). Also made some progress towards the CS50 lesson 0 assignment in Scratch.

**Thoughts:** It's been approximately 4 months since I "took a break" from the Odin Project program (because of personal issues), and I feel like I need to refresh my memory on the basics of both HTML and JavaScript, and for once commit to complete the FreeCodeCamp program, with the Odin Project one on the side.

Note: Not enough progress was made on Scratch to consider a proper git commit.
