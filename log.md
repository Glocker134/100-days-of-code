# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 26, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Started the Harvard CS50 intro to Computer Science course on edX, and completed the "basic HTML and HTML5" block on FreeCodeCamp (after restarting my progress). Also made some progress towards the CS50 lesson 0 assignment in Scratch.

**Thoughts:**  
It's been approximately 4 months since I "took a break" from the Odin Project program (because of personal issues), and I feel like I need to refresh my memory on the basics of both HTML and JavaScript, and for once commit to complete the FreeCodeCamp program, with the Odin Project one on the side.

Note: Not enough progress was made on Scratch to consider a proper git commit.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 1: February 27, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Made progress on the CS50 lesson 0 assignment, a "pop the balloons" game: Added scoring with a single balloon, the balloon's movement, the actions when popped, and the basic 60-second timer the game is meant to last. Started the "Introduction to Basic CSS" block on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**  
Still trying to figure out what things can be done with Scratch, especially in a 5-day window. Also, might consider adding a small bird-like object to be used either as a background animation or as a special scoring target.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 2: February 28, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed most of the lesson 0 assignment - game cycle is complete with introduction and instructions, score tracking, a 60-second timer, and 5 balloons with randomized behavior, added extra sound effects to the game including a BGM loop, and set a basic high score to beat.  
Reached the mid-point on the "Introduction to Basic CSS" block on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**  
The assignment is pretty much done based on the requirements, but I might refine a few things here and there. The bird idea is still on the table. I'll probably finish it in the morning and upload it to the class repo.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 3: February 29, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed the lesson 0 assignment and delivered it to the course's git folder.  
Completed the "Introduction to Basic CSS" block on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**  
Today was a bit of a slow day, since the main focus was to finish the assignment. The bird idea was discarded since there weren't decent sprites to implement the idea (and don't really have the ability to create a transparent sprite). Tomorrow's focus will be FreeCodeCamp and the video for lesson 1 of CS50.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 4: March 1st, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed 4 out 5 assignments for the lesson 1 of the CS50 course.  

**Thoughts:**  
It's been a while since I used C. Still remember a few things, and gotta remember about the pointers when the time is right. Also, I need to remember to use style50 after completing each assignment and correct the code.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 5: March 2nd, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Made progress on the last assignment for CS50, still need to work on a few extra functions for validation purposes.  
Made progress on the "Applied Visual Design" block on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**  
Not a lot of progress was made today due to sidetracking with terminal experimentation.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 6: March 3, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed all of week 1 assignments for CS50.  
Made some progress on the "Applied Visual Design" block on FreeCodeCamp.  
Started reading [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)- just the introduction for now.  

**Thoughts:**  
I need to pay attention when reading code during debugging/troubleshooting. A very easy to fix issue took me a good portion of the day. Granted, clang's output wasn't extremely helpful, but I still need to pay attention and take my time while reading.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 7: March 4, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Read chapter 1 of Eloquent JavaScript. 

**Thoughts:**  
Today was a very packed day, not enough time to do some significant progress on FreeCodeCamp or CS50, so a bit of reading should do. Tomorrow will be focused on week 2 of CS50.  

**Link to work:**  
None for today.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 8: March 5, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Started working on the lesson 2 assignments for CS50.  

**Thoughts:**  
The readability project is almost done. It could have been finished earlier, but the IDE site was throwing error 500 right after granting permission and log in. It still needs a bit of finetuning on how decimals are rounded and organizing stuff into extra functions, rather than pack everything inside the main function. Overall, it gives a correct readability grade for the rest of the tests.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 9: March 6, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Finished the readability assignment for CS50.  

**Thoughts:**  
Despite my solution being correct, I'm pretty sure that my implementation was not the "right" one in terms of code maintanability - Lack of extra functions, everything is inside the main function. I will have to return to this assignment in the future and adjust it.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 10: March 7, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Started working on the Caesar cipher assignment for CS50.

**Thoughts:**  
First time writing a program that requires a command line argument. Still need to work on validation for said argument, but at least it checks if an argument has been passed, otherwise it shows the correct/expected syntax.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 11: March 8, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Finished the Caesar cipher assignment for CS50.

**Thoughts:**  
Interestingly enough, I barely used the cs50 header due to how C handles strings, especially when not using pointers. Tomorrow's focus will be the substitution problem with a bit of FreeCodeCamp.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 12: March 9, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Started and finished the Substitution cipher assignment for CS50.  
Made some progress on the "Applied Visual Design" block on FreeCodeCamp.  

**Thoughts:**  
This problem was WAY easier to solve compared to the Caesar one due to the more rigid requirements. Granted, a few things can be copied/recycled from the Caesar code, but the core functionality was easier to plan out.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 13: March 10, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Watched the lesson 3 video for CS50.  
Made a bit of progress on FreeCodeCamp.  
Read chapter 2 of Eloquent JavaScript (exercises are pending).  

**Thoughts:**  
Didn't have to create a new set of files for the lesson 3 assignments, since most of the code is already provided and the job is to write whatever functions it requires. Will start working on Plurality tomorrow, as well as the Eloquent JavaScript exercises.  
The visual design bits in FreeCodeCamp are a bit plain. Also it gets a bit confusing when working with C and JavaScript at the same time.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 14: March 11, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Finished the plurality assignment for CS50.  
Finished the Eloquent JS lesson 2 exercises.  

**Thoughts:**  
First time I've used structs in C. It kinda reminds me of lists, but a bit more restrictive.  
Also, I've read a few things about the FizzBuzz algorithm being a "common" question in coding interviews. I have to say, the "non-ES6 heavy" answer isn't that bad - 5 lines of code by eliminating unnecessary curly braces.

### Day 15: March 12, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Finished the runoff assignment for CS50.  

**Thoughts:**  
Not a lot of progress was made today. The walkthrough video for the assignment worked wonders explaning what each function was meant to do. I will probably have to use the walkthrough video for the tideman assignment tomorrow.

### Day 16: March 13, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Started working on the Tideman assignment for CS50.  

**Thoughts:**  
This one is turning out to be a bit of a tricky one, but I THINK I should be able to complete it by tomorrow. Also I noticed I can receive a free certificate for completing CS50x with a grade of 70% or higher. There is also the paid certificate via edX, but that one can probably wait. The free one will do for now.  
The final project is going to be interesting.

### Day 17: March 14, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Read chapter 3 of Eloquent JavaScript, as well as doing the exercises for the chapter.  

**Thoughts:**  
I decided to take a day off from the Tideman assignment to continue reading Eloquent JavaScript. After all, I'm going to need a bit of extra JS knowledge for the CS50 final project.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 18: March 15, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Continued working on the Tideman assignment for CS50.  

**Thoughts:**  
Today's objective was to read about merge sort and how to implement it. The key here is that it has to be in reverse - sorting from largest to smallest. The pseudocode is ready, but I'm still trying to translate it into C code - do note, this is just the basic example implementation of reverse merge sort, I still need to edit the code in order to use it with the Tideman assignment.

**Link to work:**  
None for today.  

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 19: March 16, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Made some progress on the Tideman assignment. Finished the base version of the merge sort algorithm.  

**Thoughts:**  
The basic version of merge sort is now ready (after dealing with a couple of segfaults), Tomorrow I can start working on adjusting it to fit in the Tideman code.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 20: March 17, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Finished the merge sort function for the Tideman assignment.

**Thoughts:**  
Adapting the basic merge sort to the Tideman code was a bit of a mouthful. Clang didn't show any error while compiling, so I THINK it's good to go. I started planning how to do the lock_pairs function, but I need to read a bit more about how locking a pair should take priority.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 21: March 18, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Read chapter 4 of Eloquent JavaScript.  

**Thoughts:**  
Today was a bit of a sluggish day. Tried to work on the lock_pairs function, but I couldn't think of a way to check if the table would lead to a cycle, so I decided to read a bit more. And even then, couldn't get to retain most of the information. I will give it a second read in the morning, and then get back on track.  

**Link to work:**  
None for today.  

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 22: March 19, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Made some progress on the Tideman assignment.  

**Thoughts:**  
Turns out the lock_pairs function was a bit easier to implement than what I originally thought. Granted, I've yet to fully test the whole program, but tomorrow should be focused on debugging once I'm done with the last function.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 23: March 20, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Finished the Tideman aassignment for CS50.

**Thoughts:**  
Debugging didn't take too long, barely 30 minutes, though I still have two "errors" according to the tests, but I'm quite happy with a 92/100. I can return to this later and fix it, but for now, I can now start week 4 and get back on track (it's been 10 days trying to complete all of week 3).

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 24: March 21, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Watched CS50 lesson 4 and prepared the IDE session for the first assignment.  

**Thoughts:**  
Week 4 video was all about pointers, which I've worked with before, but remember nearly nothing about them. Additionally, future assignments can't use the cs50 header file, so the "training wheels" are officially off. As for this week's assignment, there seems to be almost no difference between filter_less and filter_more, other than one extra filter on filter_more. In the meantime, I'll focus on filter_less, then give filter_more a shot.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 25: March 22, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Started working on the chapter 4 exercises for Eloquent JavaScript.  

**Thoughts:**  
Content-wise, things are starting to get on "par" with CS50, at least in concept. I have to read a bit more about objects and how to implement "lists" in JavaScript - I remember lists in C, but the "implementation" in JS is somewhat different (considering lists aren't really a thing in JS). Still need to complete 2 more exercises.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 26: March 23, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Started working on the filter-less assignment for CS50.  

**Thoughts:**  
I tried to solve the other two Chapter 4 exercises, but I was drawing a blank on JS lists, so I decided to start working on the week 4 assignments. Turns out filter-less wasn't as problematic as I thought it'd be. I only need to implement the blur function and I'm done. I could probably read a bit about the edge detection function required for filter-more, since it's the only unique function between both versions. Also, had to fix the file in the repo since I downloaded the wrong one from the IDE.  

**Link to work:**

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 27: March 24, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Finished the blur function for the filter-less assignment.

**Thoughts:**  
Although it "works", the test results aren't matching, mostly due to rounding differences - about one digit. I need to double-check some of the steps in the blur function that apparently aren't working as intended. Corners work, but borders and the inside don't. Am I supposed to create an auxiliary array, average all original pixels and then change the picture?

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 28: March 25, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Finished the filter_less assignment for CS50.  
Started working on the recovery assignment.

**Thoughts:**  
As expected, I was supposed to copy the image's pixels to an auxiliary array and use the non-edited values for the averages. And after fixing some rounding issues, the tests passed with no issues. 
As for the first impressions with the recovery assignment, I'm going to have to read a bit about file reads and writes, especially size and how to set the read/write buffer.

**Link to work:**  
[CS50 lesson 4 repo link](https://github.com/Glocker134/CS50-projects/tree/master/lesson_4)  

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 29: March 26, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Continued working on the recovery assignment.  

**Thoughts:**  
Quite the slow day for progress. I'm having a "few" issues with file reading that I need to address ASAP. I'm slowly starting to understand how the fread arguments work, but I still need to get an idea of how the buffer is handled. Gonna have to create a new sandbox file and start tinkering around to get the idea.

**Link to work:**  
None for today.  

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 30: March 27, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Continued working on the recovery assignment.  

**Thoughts:**  
The program is now recovering some data, although not completely. It seems to be recovering the first 512 bytes of the image, and then skipping to the next, but it's also stopping at image 23 out of 50. I think I know what I need to do with the file reading so it can fully write to the file before closing it.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 31: March 28, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Finished the recover assignment.  
Started working on the filter-more assignment.  

**Thoughts:**  
After sitting down and writing on paper the pseudocode, and the help of a previous walkthrough video for the exercise, I managed to fix the errors in the code and managed to get all 50 pictures in the card file. Most of filter-more is already done thanks to filter-less (that's grayscale, reflection, and blur), and the only function I need to write is edge detection.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 32: March 29, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Finished the filter_more assignment.

**Thoughts:**  
And again, I NEED to pay attention to the variables I'm typing. Debugging could have taken WAY less time if I had noticed the wrong variable pretty much at the end of the code block. Regardless, the edge detection function works wonders and got full score on the assignment. I already set up the IDE for the pset5 exercise, so tomorrow will be video, then straight to the assignment.

### Day 33: March 30, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Watched the lesson 5 lecture for CS50.  

**Thoughts:**  
I need to rewatch the last half of the lesson to finish understanding lists and trees. Not a lot of progress code-wise, but I should be able to start working on the speller asignment tomorrow.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 34: March 31, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Finished watching the lesson 5 lecture.  
Started research on the speller assignment

**Thoughts:**  
This is going to be a toughie. There is a lot of reading involved, especially about things I didn't learn back when I took my old C class - hash tables and tries, which I'm going to need (at least hash tables). I somewhat understand the basics of a hash table, but I still don't understand the hashing process and how the keys are handled, let alone how many you might need to sort the data. And since this assignment is all about efficiency (my old enemy), I need to think about optimizing as much as possible, from memory allocation and freeing memory, to the proper way to store the dictionary in memory so I can search for a term as quickly as possible. I've already set up a Trello board with ideas and some things I should research in the morning.

None for today.  

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 35: April 1st, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Continued researching for the speller assignment.  
Added the hash function to the assignment.  

**Thoughts:**  
My original concern since yesterday was about how to hash the data, but after watching the other pending videos for the class, it was recommended to NOT create a hash function, but to find an existing one on the internet (since hashing functions are considered to be "an art, rather than a science"). After some quick searching I found djb2, which is considered a very decent and efficient string hashing function. I still need to sit down and check how many "buckets" I'm going to need for the final table, so I can start working on loading the dictionary into memory and then spell-checking.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 36: April 2nd, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Continued working on the speller assignment.

**Thoughts:**  
Another day of research, but finally managed to set up the amount of "buckets" that I'll need (though still having second thoughts on the number compared to memory used). Also, managed to complete the check function. The thing is, I have two different check functions detailed: one that checks for all the items that share the same hash index (expecting collisions just in case), and one that simply checks if the hash index has a value (expecting no collisions because of the amount of buckets). I'll have to double-check which one is the right one for the task.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 37: April 3rd, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Finished the speller assignment for CS50.  

**Thoughts:**  
I have to admit, I am surprised it worked on the first try, ignoring compiling errors. And according to the Big Board leaderboards, my code is currently on 15th place, with a lot of room to improve (over a second). I might consider improving the runtine in the future, but for now I'm calling this a win. Guess tomorrow will be Python day.
