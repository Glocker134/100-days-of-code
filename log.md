# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 26, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Started the Harvard CS50 intro to Computer Science course on edX, and completed the "basic HTML and HTML5" block on FreeCodeCamp (after restarting my progress). Also made some progress towards the CS50 lesson 0 assignment in Scratch.

**Thoughts:** It's been approximately 4 months since I "took a break" from the Odin Project program (because of personal issues), and I feel like I need to refresh my memory on the basics of both HTML and JavaScript, and for once commit to complete the FreeCodeCamp program, with the Odin Project one on the side.

Note: Not enough progress was made on Scratch to consider a proper git commit.

### Day 1: February 27, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Made progress on the CS50 lesson 0 assignment, a "pop the balloons" game: Added scoring with a single balloon, the balloon's movement, the actions when popped, and the basic 60-second timer the game is meant to last. Started the "Introduction to Basic CSS" block on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Still trying to figure out what things can be done with Scratch, especially in a 5-day window. Also, might consider adding a small bird-like object to be used either as a background animation or as a special scoring target.
