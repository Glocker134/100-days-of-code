# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 26, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Started the Harvard CS50 intro to Computer Science course on edX, and completed the "basic HTML and HTML5" block on FreeCodeCamp (after restarting my progress). Also made some progress towards the CS50 lesson 0 assignment in Scratch.

**Thoughts:**  
It's been approximately 4 months since I "took a break" from the Odin Project program (because of personal issues), and I feel like I need to refresh my memory on the basics of both HTML and JavaScript, and for once commit to complete the FreeCodeCamp program, with the Odin Project one on the side.

Note: Not enough progress was made on Scratch to consider a proper git commit.

### Day 1: February 27, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Made progress on the CS50 lesson 0 assignment, a "pop the balloons" game: Added scoring with a single balloon, the balloon's movement, the actions when popped, and the basic 60-second timer the game is meant to last. Started the "Introduction to Basic CSS" block on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**  
Still trying to figure out what things can be done with Scratch, especially in a 5-day window. Also, might consider adding a small bird-like object to be used either as a background animation or as a special scoring target.

### Day 2: February 28, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed most of the lesson 0 assignment - game cycle is complete with introduction and instructions, score tracking, a 60-second timer, and 5 balloons with randomized behavior, added extra sound effects to the game including a BGM loop, and set a basic high score to beat.  
Reached the mid-point on the "Introduction to Basic CSS" block on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**  
The assignment is pretty much done based on the requirements, but I might refine a few things here and there. The bird idea is still on the table. I'll probably finish it in the morning and upload it to the class repo.

### Day 3: February 29, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed the lesson 0 assignment and delivered it to the course's git folder.  
Completed the "Introduction to Basic CSS" block on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**  
Today was a bit of a slow day, since the main focus was to finish the assignment. The bird idea was discarded since there weren't decent sprites to implement the idea (and don't really have the ability to create a transparent sprite). Tomorrow's focus will be FreeCodeCamp and the video for lesson 1 of CS50.

### Day 4: March 1st, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed 4 out 5 assignments for the lesson 1 of the CS50 course.  

**Thoughts:**  
It's been a while since I used C. Still remember a few things, and gotta remember about the pointers when the time is right. Also, I need to remember to use style50 after completing each assignment and correct the code.

### Day 5: March 2nd, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Made progress on the last assignment for CS50, still need to work on a few extra functions for validation purposes.  
Made progress on the "Applied Visual Design" block on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**  
Not a lot of progress was made today due to sidetracking with terminal experimentation.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 6: March 3, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed all of week 1 assignments for CS50.  
Made some progress on the "Applied Visual Design" block on FreeCodeCamp.  
Started reading [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)- just the introduction for now.  

**Thoughts:**  
I need to pay attention when reading code during debugging/troubleshooting. A very easy to fix issue took me a good portion of the day. Granted, clang's output wasn't extremely helpful, but I still need to pay attention and take my time while reading.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 7: March 4, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Read chapter 1 of Eloquent JavaScript. 

**Thoughts:**  
Today was a very packed day, not enough time to do some significant progress on FreeCodeCamp or CS50, so a bit of reading should do. Tomorrow will be focused on week 2 of CS50.  

**Link to work:**  
None for today.

---------------------------------------------------------
### Day 8: March 5, 2020.

**Today's Progress:**  
Started working on the lesson 2 assignments for CS50.  

**Thoughts:**  
The readability project is almost done. It could have been finished earlier, but the IDE site was throwing error 500 right after granting permission and log in. It still needs a bit of finetuning on how decimals are rounded and organizing stuff into extra functions, rather than pack everything inside the main function. Overall, it gives a correct readability grade for the rest of the tests.
